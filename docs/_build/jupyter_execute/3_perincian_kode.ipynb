    "#### **New probability distribution of eccentricity**\n",
    "Unlike the original, this new function uses known eccentricity data from [exoplanet.org](exoplanet.org), but retains the form of a probability distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2) A function to calculate the probability of a planet's terrestriality**\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict a planet's **composition**, M-HITE uses a model developed by Zeng-Sasselov (ZS) (2013). This model assesses the density of a planet to determine its place in a spectrum of combination between three substances: Fe (iron), MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O.\n",

    "\n",
    "The plot above shows such a probability function $p_{ter}$.\n",
    "Note that this particular function is specific to a planet with a mass of 3 Earth's masses (M<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub>). Planets with different masses have different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any planet, a terrestriality chance of not zero is only possible when its radius is smaller than $\\mu_2$ (_mu2_). Moreover, if the radius is smaller than $\\mu_1$ (_mu1_), the terrestriality chance is valued as 1. These two constants, _mu1_ and _mu2_ are planet-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the code in this section is: 1) to determine the upper and lower bounds (_mu1_ and _mu2_) of the 'terrestrial range' for a given planet, and then, 2) to assess where the planet's radius fall between those boundaries and determine the planet's probability of being terrestrial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses values from a CSV table adapted from the dataset of Zeng-Sasselov (2013). This table is imported to a panda dataframe in the 'Zeng-Sasselov boundaries input' subsection below on this page. and will be called as **ZS table** from here onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of the lower bound (_mu1_)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given planet of mass _m<sub>p</sub>_, the lower bound of the 'terrestrial range' is defined as the radius that the planet would have if it was composed of pure MgSiO<sub>3</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ZS table contains several columns, two of them are labeled 'M-Pure-MgSiO3' and 'R-Pure-MgSiO3'. The values stored in these columns are mass and radius values in units of M<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub> and R<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub>, respectively. Each row of these two columns is a pair of mass-radius values that represents a planet of 100% MgSiO<sub>3</sub>.\n",

    "| ![Inside the ZS table](zeng-sasselov_2.png) |\n",
    "|:--:|\n",
    "| <b>A peek inside the ZS table</b>|\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, according to this model, a planet with a mass of 0.00623 M<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub> and a radius of 0.2029 R<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub> is considered to be composed of 100 percent MgSiO<sub>3</sub>. That means, any theoretically existing planets with that exact mass would have 0.2029 as its _mu1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we wish to find _mu1_ for exoplanet WASP-96 b (mass: 152.6 M<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub>; radius: 13.45 R<sub>ðŸœ¨</sub>). This requires us to find the radius of WASP-96 b _if it were_ a planet of pure MgSiO<sub>3</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exact value of WASP-96 b's mass is present in the 'M-Pure-MgSiO3' column, the process would be a straigtforward one: _mu1_ is its corresponding value in 'R-Pure-MgSiO3' column (i.e. the radius value that is in the same row as its mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, a planet's mass is not present in the column, such as in the case of WASP-96 b here, so we have to interpolate to approximate in-between values. Unfortunately, although the dataset is graphically algorithmic, it's not advisable to set up a global regression equation due to low accuracy. In the graphic below, the thick data points are values from the ZS table, while the dotted line is the plot of a logarithmic regression equation. It can be seen that especially for large radius, the approximation veers quite far from the actual value. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Logarithmic interpolation](zeng-sasselov_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "M-HITE solves this problem by using piece-wise linear interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the aforementioned example, we do this by first finding the bracket in the 'M-Pure-MgSiO3' column in which WASP-96 b's _m<sub>p</sub>_ is contained. The endpoints of this bracket are then used as input for a linear polynomial (uses a function from the python `scipy` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Iterating through the ZS table to place WASP-96 b' mass inside the list](zeng-sasselov_3b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture above shows a peek inside the ZS table and the 'bracket of interest' for WASP-96b. \n",
    "\n",
    "To expound on the steps that the code goes through in the process of finding these endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have already iterated through the first **43 rows** of the 'M-Pure-MgSiO3' and have not found a value bracket that contains the mass of WASP-96 b, **_m<sub>p</sub>_ = 152.6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now compare _m<sub>p</sub>_ to the value in the **44th row**, which is 140.3 and still smaller than  _m<sub>p</sub>_ = 152.6. It means that this bracket, formed by the value in the 44th row and its predecessor, is _not_ our bracket of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we go forward in the list and compare _m<sub>p</sub>_ to the value in the **45th row**, which is **158.2** and larger thann _m<sub>p</sub>_. It means that the mass of WASP-96 b is contained between this row and its predecessor--this is our bracket of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to create an interpolation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = interpolate.interp1d(x, y, kind='linear', assume_sorted=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "wherein _x_ is an array containing the endpoints of the aforementioned 'M-Pure-MgSiO3' bracket and _y_ is an array containing the corresponding values from the 'R-Pure-MgSiO3' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final piece of code looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mu1 = f(mPlanet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "wherein `mPlanet` is the mass of the planet, which in WASP-96b's case is 152.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of the  (_mu2_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to that of _mu1_ but uses these columns: 'R-MgSiO3-H2O-5050' and 'M-MgSiO3-H2O-5050'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of terrestriality probability\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is fairly straightforward. We already have the lower and upper boundaries (_mu1_ and _mu2_), and the only thing left to do to determine the terrestriality probability is to assess the actual radius of the planet compared to these boundaries. The assessment criteria and results are summarized in this table below.\n",
